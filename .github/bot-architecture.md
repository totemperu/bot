DATA_FLOW (WhatsApp Conversation):

1. User sends WhatsApp message → Meta webhook fires POST /webhook
2. Frontend webhook proxy (apps/frontend/src/routes/webhook/+server.ts) forwards
   request to backend
3. Webhook (apps/backend/src/routes/webhook.ts) extracts message text and phone
   number
4. Call processMessage(phoneNumber, message) in apps/backend/src/agent/engine.ts
5. Engine retrieves/creates conversation context from SQLite (includes current
   state, user data)
6. Check for 3-hour session timeout, reset to INIT if expired
7. Call state machine: transition({ currentState, message, context })
8. State machine returns: { nextState, commands, updatedContext }
9. Update conversation state in database
10. Execute commands sequentially:

- CHECK_FNB/CHECK_GASO → Call provider APIs
  (apps/backend/src/services/providers.ts)
- SEND_MESSAGE → WhatsApp Meta Graph API (apps/backend/src/services/whatsapp.ts)
- SEND_IMAGES → Upload images to WhatsApp, send media messages
- TRACK_EVENT → Log to analytics_events table
- NOTIFY_TEAM → Queue message in notifier service
- ESCALATE → Update conversation status to 'human_takeover'

11. Response sent to user, conversation state persisted for next message

WEBHOOK_ENDPOINTS:

- POST /webhook: Frontend proxy at apps/frontend/src/routes/webhook/+server.ts
  - Receives incoming WhatsApp messages from Meta
  - Forwards to backend asynchronously, returns 200 immediately
  - Backend extracts message text, phone number, sender info
  - Passes to processMessage() for handling
- GET /webhook: Meta challenge verification
  - Frontend proxy forwards verification request to backend
  - Backend validates hub.verify_token and returns hub.challenge

LLM_INTEGRATION: Gemini via OpenAI client at apps/backend/src/services/llm.ts

- classifyIntent(msg) → yes|no|question|unclear
- extractEntity(msg, entity) → extracted value
- Prefer regex (packages/core/src/validation/regex.ts) for structured data like
  DNI, age
- Used sparingly, state machine handles most logic

CONVERSATION_STATES: Flow in packages/core/src/state-machine/transitions.ts INIT
→ CONFIRM_CLIENT → COLLECT_DNI → WAITING_PROVIDER → COLLECT_AGE → OFFER_PRODUCTS
→ HANDLE_OBJECTION → CLOSING

- INIT: Greeting, explain service
- CONFIRM_CLIENT: Ask if they're a Calidda client
- COLLECT_DNI: Request DNI for lookup
- WAITING_PROVIDER: Query FNB (first) then GASO (fallback)
- COLLECT_AGE: For GASO clients, collect age for eligibility
- OFFER_PRODUCTS: Present catalog based on segment/credit
- HANDLE_OBJECTION: Address concerns, clarify
- CLOSING: Confirm interest, schedule follow-up, or end conversation
